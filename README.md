## About

Things is a collection of beautifully designed, blocky components that embrace a bold, raw aesthetic. Each component combines thick borders, strong shadows, and high-contrast colors to create distinctive UI elements with personality. The design system refuses the usual components of UX-UI design and embraces funky, blocky design elements that stand out.

All components are built from scratch using React and native HTML elements. No dependencies on any UI library like Radix UI, Material UI, or others. Perfect for developers who want to build bold, eye-catching interfaces without compromising on accessibility or customization. Simply copy the components into your project and make them your own.
